# Changelog

All notable changes to CodeAtlas are documented here.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Auto-generate `.agents/memory/`** — Extension now automatically creates the memory folder after every `Analyze Project` run
  - `system-map.md`, `modules.json`, `feature-flows.json`, `conventions.md` are regenerated each time
  - `business-rules.json` and `change-log.json` are preserved if they already exist (only created on first run)
- New `src/memoryGenerator.ts` module encapsulating memory generation logic

---

## [1.4.3] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- Ensure `JSON.parse` results are validated as arrays before calling `.push()` / `.unshift()` — prevents runtime errors when `business-rules.json` or `change-log.json` contain non-array data
- Applied fix to both `index.ts` and `scripts/sync-all-memory.cjs`

---

## [1.4.2] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed
- Handle undefined `stats` in `AnalysisResult` — prevents `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'files')` errors during MCP tool execution
- Made `stats`, `entityCounts`, `totalFilesAnalyzed` optional in interface with null-coalescing fallbacks
- Removed `npm run lint` from `pretest` script (lint setup missing, caused failures)

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Fixed `.agent/memory/` → `.agents/memory/` path in `index.ts` and `auto-memory.md` to match project convention

### Added
- `scripts/sync-all-memory.cjs` — Utility script to generate `.agents/memory/` for all projects at once
- Version & changelog rule in `.agents/rules/rule.md` — AI must bump version + update changelog on every change

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- **`generate_system_flow` MCP tool** — Auto-generates Mermaid flowchart diagrams from code analysis. Supports 3 scopes: `modules-only`, `full`, `feature`
- **`sync_system_memory` MCP tool** — Creates/updates `.agents/memory/` folder with 6 auto-generated files (system-map.md, modules.json, feature-flows.json, business-rules.json, change-log.json, conventions.md). Serves as AI's persistent long-term memory between conversations
- **`trace_feature_flow` MCP tool** — BFS-based feature tracing: give a keyword, get all related files sorted by dependency order with `readingOrder` for AI to follow
- **Auto-memory rule template** — `.agents/rules/auto-memory.md` forces AI to read memory at conversation start and sync after code changes
- **CodeAtlas MCP rule template** — `.agents/rules/codeatlas-mcp.md` forces AI to use MCP tools before manual grep
- **Setup guide** — `docs/AI-MEMORY-SETUP.md` with step-by-step instructions for any project
- **Rule templates** — `docs/rules-template/` folder with ready-to-copy rule files

### Changed
- MCP server version bumped to 1.4.0 (9 tools total: 6 existing + 3 new)
- `tsconfig.json` — `rootDir` changed to `.` and `index.ts` added to `include` for proper IDE type checking
- Added `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `zod` to `package.json` dependencies (were previously only available via npx)

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Auto-discover projects** — MCP server scans `~/` for all projects with `.codeatlas/analysis.json`
- **`list_projects` tool** — lists all analyzed projects with last analysis time
- All tools accept optional `project` parameter — specify by name or path
- No more hardcoded `CODEATLAS_PROJECT_DIR` needed

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **Panel toggle buttons** — hide/show left (AI Insights) and right (Entity Overview) panels
- Smooth slide animation with 0.3s transition
- Graph auto-expands to fill space when panels are hidden

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **MCP Server** — AI assistants can query CodeAtlas analysis data via Model Context Protocol
  - `get_project_structure` — list all modules, classes, functions, variables
  - `get_dependencies` — import/call/containment relationships
  - `get_insights` — AI-generated code insights
  - `search_entities` — fuzzy search by entity name with relationships
  - `get_file_entities` — all entities in a specific file
- Extension now saves analysis to `.codeatlas/analysis.json` for MCP server
- `.gemini/settings.json` MCP config included

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **`excludedFiles` setting** — skip generated stub files (e.g. `_ide_helper.php`)
- Default excludes: `_ide_helper.php`, `_ide_helper_models.php`, `.phpstorm.meta.php`

### Fixed
- Laravel `_ide_helper.php` (28k lines, 2072 method stubs) flooding the graph with framework functions

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-21

### Added
- **PHP parser** — regex-based extraction of classes, interfaces, traits, enums, functions, properties, constants, namespaces, `use` statements
- **Blade template parser** — `@extends`, `@include`, `@component`, `<x-component>`, `@section`, `@yield`
- **Per-project config** — `codeatlas.fileExtensions` and `codeatlas.excludedDirectories` via `.vscode/settings.json`
- `.php` added to default `fileExtensions`
- `vendor`, `storage` added to default `excludedDirectories`
- Color coding: PHP `#4F5D95`, Blade `#FF2D20`, Interface `#7209b7`, Trait `#06d6a0`, Enum `#ffd166`

### Fixed
- **Webview race condition** — data sent before React mounted; added `webviewReady` handshake with message buffering
- **Blank webview** — moved `acquireVsCodeApi()` before React bundle; fixed CSS filename mismatch (`style.css` vs `index.css`)
- **JS error on load** — variable name collision (`el`) between inline script and Vite bundle
- **`graphPhysics` undefined** — replaced with default values
- **Phantom function nodes** — orphan links filtered from graph; `react-force-graph` no longer auto-creates nodes for undefined targets
- **CSS layout** — full rewrite: proper flexbox layout, left/right panels visible, graph centered, status bar flow-based
